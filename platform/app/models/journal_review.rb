# The reviewer's call on one journal in a Submission: how much of its logged time counts, and why when it isn't all
# of it. Deciding the submission copies `approved_minutes` onto the journal (Journal#reviewed_minutes), and its XP
# follows. A journal looked at again in a later submission starts from the last call made on it.
