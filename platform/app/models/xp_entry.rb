# One line in the XP ledger; users.xp is the sum of the kept ones. A journal's entry follows its hours, less any a
# design reviewer took off (Journal#counted_minutes, Journal#sync_xp), and keeps the multiplier the person had when it was first saved. Deleting its source discards the
# entry rather than removing it, so the ledger still shows what was earned and taken back. Everything else is granted once: by its source, or by kind
# and day, so a week can be closed again without paying twice. `day` is the person's own calendar day. A transfer's
# XP is the amount its reviewer set (ProjectTransfer#approve); its journals earn none of their own. `pet` is the team
# the person was on when it was made, which it counts for in the race whatever they switch to later.
